# OAuth2

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external apps request authorization to private details in a userâ€™s ThingPlus account without getting their password.

All developers need to register their application before getting started. A registered OAuth application is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret. The Client Secret should not be shared.

(NOTE: Registration of application is not ready now. Contact ThingPlus administrator until we are ready)

## OAuth 2.0 Grant Types    

### Authorization Code Grant (or Web Server)
#### Step 1
Redirect the user to allow or not for the Web Server(or Confidential Client) to access the resources of the user with registered scopes

```json
GET https://api.thingplus.net/v1/oauth2/authorize

Example>
  GET https://api.thingplus.net/v1/oauth2/authorize?client_id={CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}
```

* URL Query parameters

|      Name     |      Type     |                         Description                          
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ 
| client_id     | string        | __Required__ The client ID you received from thingplus
| response_type | string        | __Required__ Use "code"
| redirect_uri  | string        | __Required__ The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization.

#### Step 2
ThingPlus redirects back to your site with "code" in url when the user accepted your request

```json
{REDIRECT_URI}/?code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}
```

#### Step 3
Exchange code for an Access token

```
POST https://api.thingplus.net/v1/oauth2/token

Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

* Body parameters

|      Name     |      Type     |                         Description                          
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ 
| code          | string        | __Required__ The code you received as a response from Step 2
| grant_type    | string        | __Required__ Use "authorization_code"
| redirect_uri  | string        | __Required__ The redirect URL when you registered your application
| client_id     | string        | __Required__ The client ID you received from thingplus when you registered your application
| client_secret | string        | __Required__ The client secret you received from thingplus when you registered your application


### Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
#### Step 1
Get an Access token with resource owner(user) password credentials

NOTE: This grant is not allowed for the 3rd party applications

```
POST https://api.thingplus.net/v1/oauth2/token

Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

* Body parameters

|      Name     |      Type     |                         Description                          
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ 
| grant_type    | string        | __Required__ Use "password"
| client_id     | string        | __Required__ The client ID you received from thingplus when you registered your application
| client_secret | string        | __Required__ The client secret you received from thingplus when you registered your application
| username      | string        | __Required__ The username of the resource owner(user)
| password      | string        | __Required__ The password of the resource owner(user) - MD5 Hash code

> NOTE: password must be MD5 hash code. For more information visit [JavaScript-MD5](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5)


## Limitations
* Authorization code
  - Expire in 10 minutes
  - Exchange for the Access token is possible only one time

* Access token
  - Authorization Code Grant: Expire in 15 days
  - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant: Expire in 90 days
  - Possibly can be changed without advance notification

## Scopes
Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has.

For the Authorization Code Grant, requested scopes will be displayed to the user on the authorize form.

|     Scope          |                Name              |                         Description
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
